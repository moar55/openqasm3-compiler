\chapter{Conclusion}
Due to limitations faced by the quantum computing team in WMI, we were not able to execute
    the quantum heterogeneous generated MLIR code on their hardware.
    However, as also another proof of concept, we created a quantum simulator written purely in MLIR
    to test out our compilation pipeline. This was also useful to
     showcase the possibility to write a quantum simulator purely in MLIR,
    which could have superior performance than calling external c++ (or other languages) code from within our MLIR code.
